# Double-Pendulum-Simulation
A matlab program to simulate the motion of the double pendulum.

**Project Description**

Double pendulum is a system consisting of a pendulum hanging from a point with another pendulum attached to the weight at the end of the first pendulum. Throughout the project a model for the system will be carried out using Lagrangian mechanics discussing the states of the sys- tem, namely, position, angular velocities, and the energy contained in the system. The modeling part resulted in having two second order ordinary differential equations describing the motion. The equations of motions (EOM) will be solved numerically and the system states will be discussed.
